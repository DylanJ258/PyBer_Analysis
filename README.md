# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment asking you to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. They want this new summary DataFrame along with the multiple-line graph in order to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
* Rural
  * Total Rides = 125
  * Total Drivers = 78
  * Total Fares = $4,327.93
  * Average Fare per Ride = $34.62
  * Average Fare per Driver = $55.49
  * Rural has the least total amount of rides and drivers
  * Rural has the highest average fare per ride and per driver
* Suburban
  * Total Rides = 625
  * Total Drivers = 490
  * Total Fares = $19,356.33
  * Average Fare per Ride = $30.97
  * Average Fare per Driver = $39.50
  * Suburban is in between rural and urban for total number of rides and fares
  * Suburban is also in between rural and urban for average fare per ride and per driver
* Urban
  *Total Rides = 1625
  * Total Drivers = 2405
  * Total Fares = $39,854.38
  * Average Fare per Ride = $24.53
  * Average Fare per Driver = $16.57

## Summary
* Cut back on drivers in Urban areas in order to increase average fare per driver
* Consider changing prices for different city types based on how many rides they are
  * Higher charges in urban areas where theres more rides
  * Lower charges in rural areas where its less rides
* Consider changing prices in different city types based on distances
  * Higher charges per mile in urban areas
  * Lower charges per mile in rural areas
